Overview
=====================
In a nutshell, PJSIP is released under dual-license scheme, namely GPL and
proprietary license. PJSIP is shipped with third-party software, and may be
linked with external third-party software, most of them are open source.

If you are building open source software, probably this is everything 
you need to know and you should be all set (but IANAL).

If you are developing closed source software, however, you probably want to
know the details of the terms of the licenses below.


The SOFTWARE
=====================
PJSIP software ("**The SOFTWARE**") consists of:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0

   * - `PJLIB <../api/pjlib/index.html>`_
     - A cross-platforms portability and framework library
   * - `PJLIB-UTIL <../api/pjlib-util/index.html>`_
     - An adjunct library to pjlib which provides various utility functions
   * - `PJNATH <../api/pjnath/index.html>`_
     - A NAT traversal helper library
   * - `PJMEDIA <../api/pjmedia/index.html>`_
     - A multimedia communications library

     - High level C user agent library
   * - `PJSUA2 <../api/pjsua2/index.html>`_
     - High level C++/Java/Python/SWIG user agent library

and any and all build scripts, makefiles, tools, samples, and/or applications available 
and/or required to use or modify such software.

The SOFTWARE may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively 
"**Third Party Software**") to implement various functions, and access to Third Party Software 
may be included along with the SOFTWARE delivery as a convenience. Third Party Software 
does not comprise part of the SOFTWARE. 


License
------------------------
The SOFTWARE is released under dual license, open source (GPL) or 
an alternative license.

The SOFTWARE may be used according to Free Software GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, 
or (at your option) any later version, with special exception to permit linking with 
some Open Source Third Party libraries set out below.

The GPL allows you to compile, modify, link, or combine The SOFTWARE with other software, 
commercial or non-commercial, as long as the resulting program complies with GPL (see 
the GPL Compliance Guide for what this means). Copy of GNU General Public License is 
available on the http://www.gnu.org. More information about GPL can be found in
`GPL FAQ <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html>`_.


Alternative license
------------------------
If you can't comply with GPL, an alternative licensing scheme may be arranged.

If you still have questions, just email icensing@pjsip.org and we'll help you sort it out.


Special Exception
------------------------
As a special exception to GPL, the author of the SOFTWARE gives permission to link 
the SOFTWARE with Open Source Third Party Software below, and distribute the linked 
combinations. GNU General Public License must be obeyed in all respects for all of the 
code used other than those Third Party Software. 


Third Party Software Licensing Requirements
------------------------------------------------
In addition to the licensing requirements of the SOFTWARE, you must make sure that your 
software meets the licensing requirements of the third party libraries below. Some third 
party libraries may require attributions to be placed in the software, significant portion 
of the software, and/or in the accompanying documentation. 


Third Party SOFTWARE
=====================
The SOFTWARE may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively "Third Party 
Software") to iplement various functions, and access to Third Party Software may be 
included along with the SOFTWARE delivery as a convenience. Third Party Software does not 
comprise part of the SOFTWARE.

The use of Third Party Software may or may not be made optional (depending on the nature of 
the software).

         Since the original version of the code is put in public domain,

   * - Location

   * - Description
     - MD5 hashing for digest authentication. 
   * - License
     - This software is put in public domain, and can be used for any purpose with no warranty::

         This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
         The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
         written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
         This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

         Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
         This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
         except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
         with every copy.

         To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
         MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
         needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
         will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

         services. There are no additional requirements or authorizations necessary for these 
         algorithms to be implemented.

   * - Using the Software
     - The Milenage and Rijndael implementation will only be linked with application if
