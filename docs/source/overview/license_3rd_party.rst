   * - Location
     - https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/blob/master/pjlib/src/pj/ssl_sock_ossl.c
   * - Description
     - OpenSSL is used as the backend implementation of PJLIB's secure socket, which among 
       other thing is used by PJSIP's SIP TLS transport object. 
   * - License
     - The OpenSSL library is licensed under 
       `Apache-style license <http://www.openssl.org/source/license.html>`__, but this is 
       deemed to be `incompatible with GPL <http://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html>`_
       (hence we give explicit permission to link with it).
   * - Usage
     - The library will use OpenSSL if ``PJ_HAS_SSL_SOCK`` is set to non-zero. It is 
       detected automatically with the GNU build system, and must be set manually on 
       other build systems (e.g. Windows and Symbian)
