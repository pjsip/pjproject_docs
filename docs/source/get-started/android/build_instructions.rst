Build Instructions
===================

Requirements
-------------

* You need the `Android NDK <http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html>`__.
* Optional if you want to build and and run the sample applications (i.e: pjsua2 
  and pjsua):
  
  * `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/download.html>`_
  * `Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>`_

Build Preparation
------------------
#. :doc:`Getting the source code </get-started/getting>` if you haven't already.
#. Set your :ref:`config_site.h <dev_start>` to the following:

.. code-block:: c

   /* Activate Android specific settings in the 'config_site_sample.h' */
   #define PJ_CONFIG_ANDROID 1
   #include <pj/config_site_sample.h>
  
Building PJSIP
---------------

Just run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cd /path/to/your/pjsip/dir
   $ export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/path_to_android_ndk_dir 
   $ ./configure-android
   $ make dep && make clean && make

.. tip::

   On MinGW32/MSys, use absolute path format ``D:/path/to/android/ndk`` 
   instead of ``/D/path/to/android/ndk`` for setting ``ANDROID_NDK_ROOT``.

This will build armV64 target, to build for other targets such as ``armeabi-v7a, x86`` 
see next section.

Building for other architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Make sure to cleanup all existing binary and intermediate files, e.g:
  
   .. code-block:: shell

      $ cd /path/to/your/pjsip/dir
      $ make clean

      # cleanup pjsua sample app
      $ cd pjsip-apps/src/pjsua/android/jni
      $ make clean

      # also cleanup pjsua2 sample app (SWIG)
      $ cd /path/to/your/pjsip/dir
      $ cd pjsip-apps/src/swig
      $ make clean

* Specify the target arch in ``TARGET_ABI`` and run it with ``--use-ndk-cflags``, 
  for example: 

   .. code-block:: shell

      TARGET_ABI=arm64-v8a ./configure-android --use-ndk-cflags

   Also you should adjust `Application.mk <https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html#gc>`__ 
   and `library packaging path <https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html#am>`__ 
   (see also :pr:`1803`).

   .. note:: 

      * The ``./configure-android`` is a wrapper that calls the standard ``./configure`` 
        script with settings suitable for Android target. Standard ``./configure`` 
        options should be applicable to this script too.
      * Please check ``./configure-android --help`` for more info.
      * Other customizations are similar to what is explained in 
        :doc:`Building with GNU Tools/Autoconf </get-started/posix/build_instructions>` 
        page.

Video Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features
````````

Video on Android will be supported since PJSIP version 2.4. It has the following 
features:

* native capture
* native OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer (requires Android 2.2 (API level 8) or higher).
* H.264 codec (via OpenH264 library or AMediaCodec, see below)

Requirements
````````````

OpenH264 (this is recommended if you need H264 codec)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides video codec H.264, alternatively you can use ffmpeg (together with 
libx264).

#. Follow the instructions in ticket :pr:`1947`.
#. Copy all library .so files into your Android application project directory, 
   for example:

.. code-block:: shell

   cp /Users/me/openh264/android/*.so /Users/me/pjproject-2.0/pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/libs/armeabi

libvpx (if you need VP8 or VP9 codec)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get `libvpx <https://www.webmproject.org/code/ libvpx>`_

ffmpeg (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides format conversion and video manipulation as well as video codecs: H.264 
(together with libx264) and H263P/H263-1998.

#. Follow the instructions from the web on how to build ffmpeg for android. 
   We followed the instructions provided `here <http://www.roman10.net/how-to-build-ffmpeg-with-ndk-r9/>`__ 
   and successfully built with Android NDK r10.
#. Copy all library .so files into your Android application project directory, 
   for example:

   .. code-block:: shell

      cp /Users/me/src/ffmpeg-2.5/android/arm/lib/*.so /Users/me/pjproject-2.0/pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/libs/armeabi


AMediaCodec, native Android codecs (experimental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is available since 2.11, it provides H264, VP8, and VP9 video codecs 
(also AMR-NB & AMR-WB audio codecs). Please check :pr:`2552` for how to enable it.

Configuring
````````````

To enable video, append this into ``config_site.h``:

.. code-block:: c

   #define PJMEDIA_HAS_VIDEO 1

Specify third-party video libraries when invoking ``./configure-android``, e.g:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./configure-android --with-openh264=/Users/me/openh264/android

Make sure openh264 is detected by ``./configure-android``:

.. code-block:: shell

   ...
   Using OpenH264 prefix... /Users/me/openh264/android
   checking OpenH264 availability... ok
   ...

.. note:: 

   If you use PJSIP before version 2.6, you need to specify external libyuv via 
   the configure script param ``--with-libyuv``, check :pr:`1776` for more info.

Adding Video Capture Device to Your Application
```````````````````````````````````````````````

Copy the java part of PJSIP Android capture device to the application's source 
directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   cp pjmedia/src/pjmedia-videodev/android/PjCamera*.java [your_app]/src/org/pjsip/


Since 2.12, the capture device uses ``Camera2`` API (see also :pr:`2797` for 
more info), application need to configure the ``CameraManager`` instance 
in ``PjCameraInfo2`` before using the camera, e.g:

.. code-block:: java

   @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
   {
      //..
      CameraManager cm = (CameraManager)getSystemService(Context.CAMERA_SERVICE);
      PjCameraInfo2.SetCameraManager(cm);
      //..
   }

Using Video API
```````````````
Please check :doc:`Video User's Guide </pjsua2/using/media_video>`.

Video capture orientation support
`````````````````````````````````

To send video in the proper orientation (i.e. head always up regardless of the 
device orientation), application needs to do the following:

#. Setup the application to get orientation change notification 
   (by adding ``android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|screenSize"`` 
   in the application manifest file and override the callback ``onConfigurationChanged()``).
#. Inside the callback, call PJSUA2 API ``VidDevManager::setCaptureOrient()`` 
   to set the video device to the correct orientation.

For sample usage, please refer to pjsua2 sample app. Ticket :pr:`1861` explains 
this feature in detail.

OpenSSL Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Build OpenSSL (tested with OpenSSL 1.0.2s) for Android.
   The instruction provided here is specifically for arm64. 
   For other architectures, modify accordingly. 

   Please visit `this page <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-ANDROID.md>`__ 
   for reference and some examples. 

   .. note:: 

      You need to change the NDK path and the API platform level below.

   .. code-block:: shell

      cd openssl-3.0.4

      export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=[your_android_ndk_path]

      # Change the host as required (e.g: linux -> darwin)
      PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH

      ./Configure android-arm64 -D__ANDROID_API__=29

      make

   Then copy the libraries into lib folder:

   .. code-block:: shell

      mkdir lib
      cp lib*.a lib/

#. Specify OpenSSL location when running ``configure-android``, for example 
   (with Bash): (change the openssl path folder)

   .. code-block:: shell

      TARGET_ABI=arm64-v8a ./configure-android --use-ndk-cflags --with-ssl=[your_openssl_path]

   And check that OpenSSL is detected by the configure script:

   .. code-block::

      ...
      checking for OpenSSL installations..
      checking openssl/ssl.h usability... yes
      checking openssl/ssl.h presence... no
      aconfigure: WARNING: openssl/ssl.h: accepted by the compiler, rejected by the preprocessor!
      aconfigure: WARNING: openssl/ssl.h: proceeding with the compiler's result
      checking for openssl/ssl.h... yes
      checking for ERR_load_BIO_strings in -lcrypto... yes
      checking for SSL_library_init in -lssl... yes
      OpenSSL library found, SSL support enabled
      ...

#. Build the libraries:

   .. code-block:: shell

      make dep && make

   If you encounter linking errors, you need to add this in ``user.mak``:

   .. code-block:: shell

      export LIBS += "-ldl -lz"

Trying our sample application and creating your own
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting up the target device
````````````````````````````

To run or debug application (such as the sample applications below), 
first we need to setup the target device: 

* using virtual device: http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html
* using real device: http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html

.. _android_pjsua2:

Building and running pjsua2 sample application
```````````````````````````````````````````````

A sample application using :doc:`pjsua2 API </api/pjsua2/ref>` with SWIG Java binding, 
is located under :source:`pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android`. It is not built by 
default, and you need `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/download.html>`__ to build it.

Follow these steps to build pjsua2 sample application:

#. Make sure SWIG is in the build environment PATH.
#. Run ``make`` from directory :source:`pjsip-apps/src/swig` (note that the 
   Android NDK root should be in the PATH), e.g:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ cd /path/to/your/pjsip/dir
      $ cd pjsip-apps/src/swig
      $ make

   This step should produce:

   * native library ``libpjsua2.so`` in ``pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi``

     .. note::
 
        If you are building for other target ABI, you'll need to manually move ``libpjsua2.so`` 
        to the appropriate target ABI directory, e.g: ``jniLibs/armeabi-v7a``, 
        please check `here <https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html#am>`__ 
        for target ABI directory names.

   * pjsua2 Java interface (a lot of ``.java`` files) in 
     `pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/java/org/pjsip/pjsua2`

#. Make sure any library dependencies are copied to 
   ``pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi``
   (or the appropriate target ABI directory), e.g: ``libopenh264.so`` for video 
   support.
#. Open pjsua2 app project in Android Studio, it is located in 
   :source:`pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android`.
#. Run it.

Log output
~~~~~~~~~~

The pjsua2 sample application will write log messages to **LogCat** window.

.. _android_create_app:

Creating your own application
`````````````````````````````

For developing Android application, you should use :doc:`pjsua2 API </api/pjsua2/ref>` 
whose Java interface available via SWIG Java binding.

#. First, build ``pjproject`` libraries as described above.
#. Also build ``pjsua2 sample application`` as described above, this step is 
   required to generate the pjsua2 Java interface and the native library.
#. Create Android application outside the PJSIP sources for your project.
#. Get pjsua2 Java interface and native library from pjsua2 sample application:

   #. Copy pjsua2 Java interface files from 
      ```pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/java`` to your 
      project's ``app/src/main/java`` folder, e.g:

      .. code-block:: shell

         $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_DIR/app/src/main/java
         $ cp -r $PJSIP_DIR/pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/java .

         # Cleanup excess pjsua2 application sources.
         $ rm -r org/pjsip/pjsua2/app

   #. Copy native library ``libpjsua2.so`` from 
      ``pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/jniLibs`` to your 
      project's ``app/src/main/jniLibs`` folder:

      .. code-block:: shell

         $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_DIR/app/src/main/jniLibs
         $ cp -r $PJSIP_DIR/{pjsip-apps/src/swig/java/android/app/src/main/jniLibs .

#. Start writing your application, please check 
   `pjsua2 docs <http://www.pjsip.org/docs/book-latest/html/index.html>`__ for 
   reference.

Pjsua sample application with telnet interface
``````````````````````````````````````````````
There is also the usual `pjsua <http://www.pjsip.org/pjsua.htm>`__ with telnet 
command line user interface, which is located under :source:`pjsip-apps/src/pjsua/android`. 
It is not built by default and you need `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/download.html>`__ 
to build it. Application flow and user interface are handled mainly in the native 
level, so it doesn't use pjsua2 API with Java interface.

Follow these steps to build pjsua:

#. Make sure that pjsua app is included on the build.
   
   Call this before calling ``configure-android``

   .. code-block:: shell

      EXPORT EXCLUDE_APP=0

#. Proceed to normal build by calling ``configure-android``, ``make dep``, ``make``
#. Make sure SWIG is in the build environment PATH.
   Alternatively, update SWIG path in :source:`pjsip-apps/src/pjsua/android/jni/Makefile` 
   file.
#. Run ``make`` from directory :source:`pjsip-apps/src/pjsua/android/jni`. 
   The Android NDK root should be in the PATH, e.g:
   
   .. code-block:: shell

      $ cd /path/to/your/pjsip/dir
      $ cd pjsip-apps/src/pjsua/android/jni
      $ make

#. Open pjsua2 app project in Android Studio, it is located in 
   :source:`pjsip-apps/src/pjsua/android`.
#. Run it.
#. You will see telnet instructions on the device's screen. Telnet to this 
   address to operate the application. See 
   :doc:`CLI Manual </specific-guides/other/cli_cmd>`.
